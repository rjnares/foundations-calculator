# Calculator

This is a basic calculator web application created as a project assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Project Description

The project consists of a UI that has a display for current values and buttons for operations, functions, and number tokens (`0-9` and the decimal point `.`). The operations include addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`). The functions include all-clear (`AC`), positive/negative (`+/-`), and delete (`DEL`). This calculator operates on a single pair of operands at a time, such that, chaining operators will execute the previous operator on the two operands before allowing input of the next operand value for the current operator. Here is an example:
1. User enters `12`
2. User clicks the addition (`+`) operator
3. User enters `7`
4. User clicks the subtraction (`-`) operator
5. `12+7` is calculated and the result `19` is displayed
6. User enters `10`
7. User clicks the equals (`=`) operator
8. `19-10` is calculated and the result `9` is displayed

## Skills Applied

The goal of this simple project was to apply all the skills learned from the [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) course. This includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics.
